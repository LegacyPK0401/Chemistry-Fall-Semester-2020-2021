    <p>Below you will find the shortcuts to a summary of each lesson from each week:</p>
    <br>
        <li class="li2">Week 1: Introduction & Obsevation Vs. Inference</li>
        
        <p>On the first week of chemistry, we learned about the differences between abservations and inference. To put it simply, observations are things that can be proven while inferences are things that are predicted or a guess abou the phenomenon.</p>

    <li class="li2">Week 2: Mindfulness & Introduction to Modeling in Science</li>
        
        <p>On the second week of chemistry, we learned that on Mondays, classes will focus on the concept of mindfulness and how important it is for the mind. But otherwise, this week of chemistry is about modeling phenomena in science. We had to learn about modeling and how it is important in science. As a brief overview, modeling is when a scientist is trying to explain a phenomenon through diagrams and drawings.</p>

    <li class="li2">Week 3: Modifying Scientific Models</li>
    
    <p>On the third week of chemistry, we learned about the importance of revising scientific models. We learned that not every model is perfect. In order for a model to convey a phenomena with detail, it must be revised multiple times and reviewed by peers.</p>

    <li class="li2">Week 4: Intro to Chemistry Continued</li>
    
    <p>On the fourth week of chemistry, we further enhanced how knowledge of chemistry and the implications chemistry has on the real world. One thing we learned about was calorimetry. Calorimetry "is the process of measuring the amount of heat released or absorbed during a chemical reaction." Basicially, calorimetry is when a scientist measures the amount of heat a substance can absorb or distribute. Measuring the heat of a subtance allows the scientist to determine the energy content in that substance. Calorimetry is primarily used in food science to see the energy content of a food item.</p>

    <li class="li2">Week 5: Unit Calculations & Energy Transfers</li>
    
    <p>On the fifth week of chemistry, we learned about the uses of math in science and the transference of energy. We learnedthat "math + science = chemistry." We also learned about the units that are used in chemistry and the International System of Units. Which was created in the 1960s based on the metric system. We also discussed the importance of having a standard set of units for everyone so that no one gets confused. On the second class of the week, we learned about exothermic and endothermic energy and differences between them. As a brief summary, exothermic is when energy is released and the temperature in the surroundings rise. While endothermic is when energy is consumed and the temperature in the surroundings lower.</p>
